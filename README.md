This App uses a KLM API, that as of 12-12-2016 is no longer available to us. So it will use fake data to show the functions in it. Please do note, this is a working prototype. And cannot be used for anything else then demo.

People who find this code, and code review it, have fun! This is not production code, this was a Goat Rodeo! People who find this code, and would like to use part(s) of it. You can, but please give credits in at least the comments in your code.
